# Styling
Original stylesheet credits:
>Big Picture by HTML5 UP
>html5up.net | @ajlkn
>Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)

To make modifications to the stylesheet, edit the _custom.scss file in assets/sass/. This file is injected at the end of main.scss and can be used to override any of the original styling in the template.

To save modifications, install SASS and use
```
scss -t compressed main.scss main.min.css
```
to minify and save to standard CSS. Then move main.min.css to assets/css/. The main.min.css.map file can be deleted.
