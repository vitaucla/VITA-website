                Welcome to VITA at UCLA!
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>
                    Currently, we are not offering any appointments. Please check back January of next year for our tax site availability. If you have any questions or concerns, please submit them through our contact form.
                </strong>
                <br /> Founded in 1987, VITA at UCLA provides free federal and state income tax preparation assistance to low-
                to moderate-income, disabled, and elderly individuals in the Los Angeles community. It is our goal to help
                and educate people in filing tax returns to help clarify the process and provide assistance to those who
                otherwise would go without aid. Each year, we train approximately 200 UCLA undergraduate students in individual
                income tax preparation. In 2017, our volunteers served hundreds of clients, saving them over $450,000 through
                tax refunds and credits.

                    Students at UCLA may join VITA during Fall or Winter quarters. Volunteers will be equipped to file tax returns through extensive,
                    interactive training sessions. Volunteers will learn about general tax concepts and tax situations for low-income,
                    international, and elderly clients. Additionally, training sessions will include tax client simulations in
                    order to train volunteers for client interactions. For Fall volunteers, training will take place over a 7
                    week period from Weeks 3 to 9 (no training on week 8), with an additional 2 weeks of training during Winter
                    quarter in Weeks 1 and 2. For Winter volunteers, trainings are condensed into a 4 week course from Weeks
                    3 to 6. Tax sites will last from the end of January to mid-April.
