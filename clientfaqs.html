                                All of our volunteers have undergone extensive tax filing training and are certified by the IRS to file tax returns. Additionally,
                                each return is quality reviewed twice before being sent to the IRS, so at least three volunteers
                                individually check your return before filing to ensure no mistakes are made.

                                First, you should always file your return on time to minimize your tax penalties. A tax extension does not give you more
                                time to pay any taxes owed; it only extends the deadline for filing your return! If you can
                                pay all your taxes in 120 days or less, you may qualify for a short-term extension to pay
                                from the IRS; check the IRS website. You can also pay off your debt over time by applying
                                for an installment agreement, which is a monthly payment plan. You may qualify for an online
                                installment payment agreement with the IRS as long as you owe $50,000 or less.
