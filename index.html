            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <p>
                VITA at UCLA has been providing free income tax preparation and assistance to low-income and elderly individuals in the Los
                Angeles community since 1987. Our mission is to not only help people file their taxes, but also to educate
                them and demystify tax planning. We hope to clarify the tax planning and filing process as well as provide
                assistance to those who would otherwise go without aid. Each year, we rigorously train approximately 200
                UCLA undergraduate students in personal income tax preparation, culminating in a final exam administered
                by the IRS and certification in tax preparation. In 2016, our volunteers assisted approximately 1,225 clients
                and saved them nearly $300,000 through tax refunds and credits.

            <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <p>Students at UCLA may join VITA during Fall or Winter quarters. Volunteers will be equipped to file tax returns
                through extensive, interactive training sessions. At these training sessions volunteers will learn about
                general tax concepts and specialized income tax situations for low-income, international, and elderly clients.
                Additionally, training sessions will include tax client simulations in order to train volunteers for client
                interactions. For Fall volunteers, training will take place over a 6 week period from Weeks 3 to 8, with
                an additional 2 weeks of training during Winter quarter in Weeks 1 and 2. For Winter volunteers, trainings
                are condensed into a 4 week course from Weeks 2 to 6 so that volunteers may serve as many clients as possible
                during tax season. During Winter and Spring quarters, volunteers will serve clients up until April. Does
                all that sound good to you? Join today! No prior experience is required! VITA is open to all majors!
            </p>
            <p><strong>We are not yet ready to receive applications for Fall 2017, please check back again soon!</strong></p>

            <p><strong> Who can file their taxes with VITA?</strong></p>
            <p>We primarily serve low-income and elderly individuals residing in the state of California. Please note that
                <em>at this time this site is not equipped to file married-filing-separate (MFS) returns, itemized returns, or
                    out of state returns.</em></p>
            <p><strong>What should I bring to the tax site?</strong></p>

                <li>(2b) If you, your spouse, or your dependents do not have an SSN, an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number

                <li>(10) A copy of last year’s federal and state returns.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li><strong>Notes for certain situations:</strong></li>
                <li>(1) To file taxes electronically on a married-filing-jointly (MFJ) tax return, <em>both spouses</em> must
                    be present to sign the required forms.
                </li>
                <li>(2a) If you are a foreign non-resident, we are unable to file tax returns unless you have access to GLACIER
                    tax preperation services (through UCLA or other employer).</li>
                <li>(2b) If you are a foreign non-resident with access to GLACIER, please fill out your GLACIER forms prior to
                    tax site. If you do not have your GLACIER forms fully filled out, we are unable to file for you.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Do I need to make an appointment?</strong></p>
            <p>We accept walk-ins, but due to limited time and availability on each day, we cannot guarantee walk-ins will be
                served. If it is possible, please make an appointment to ensure service will be provided.</p>

            <p><strong>How are VITA members qualified to file on my behalf?</strong></p>
            <p>All of our volunteers have undergone extensive tax filing training and are certified by the IRS to file tax returns.
                Additionally, each return is quality reviewed twice before being sent to the IRS, so at least three volunteers
                individually check your return before filing to ensure no mistakes are made.</p>

            <p><strong>How do I sign up for appointments? When and where are tax sites?</strong></p>
            <p>Please visit our <a href="#events">events calendar</a> and click on a day to make an appointment.</p>

            <p><strong>There are no appointments available! What do I do?</strong></p>
            <p>Due to our high demand as we get closer to the filing deadline, appointments are limited and go quickly. You
                are welcome to walk-in; we recommend you come as early as possible since appointments have priority.</p>

            <p><strong>What is the average wait time for walk-ins?</strong></p>
            <p>Depending on how busy our tax sites are, the wait time may range from 15 minutes to several hours.</p>

            <p><strong>At what time do you stop accepting walk-ins?</strong></p>
            <p>We stop accepting walk-ins 1 hour before tax site closes. This is because the filing process is usually very
                lengthy, and we want to ensure accuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>How long will it take to complete my tax return?</strong></p>
            <p>Depending on your individual situation, the process may range from 45 minutes to several hours. For each return,
                we prepare, review, print, and walk-through it with the client to ensure accuracy and satisfaction before
                filing. </p>

            <p><strong>If I don’t have enough money in my account to pay my tax due, what do I do?</strong></p>
            <p>First, you should always file your return on time to minimize your tax penalties. A tax extension does not give
                you more time to pay any taxes owed; it only extends the deadline for filing your return! If you can pay
                all your taxes in 120 days or less, you may qualify for a short-term extension to pay from the IRS; check
                the IRS website. You can also pay off your debt over time by applying for an installment agreement, which
                is a monthly payment plan. You may qualify for an online installment payment agreement with the IRS as long
                as you owe $50,000 or less.</p>

            <p><strong>When will I get my refund?</strong></p>
            <p>If you e-file with us, we process returns at the end of every week and send it to the IRS. The IRS can take from
                two weeks to a month to process your returns and deposit your refund.</p>

            <p><strong>Where can I park?</strong></p>
            <p><img src="images/parking.png" width="300" height="300"></p>
            <p><em>Parking Rates/ Fee: </em>UCLA Parking Pay Stations give you short-term parking options in lots and structures
                located throughout campus. Rates range from $1.00 for 20 minutes to $12 for the entire day.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Where are tax sites?</strong></p>
            <p>Our on-campus tax sites are primarily located at <em>Ackerman Viewpoint Conference Rooms A and B</em> in Ackerman
                Union at UCLA. We also have off-campus tax sites at different locations in the LA area; check the
